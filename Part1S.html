        A person who was near to me counted: 3… 2… 1… GO! 
        I was unsure if it was still a good idea: I only had a few seconds to reflect. Finally, I threw myself down the “launchpad” and I felt butterflies in my stomach. 
        I remember that I have experienced the same feeling when I am in the car and there was a big downhill; this time, the feeling was definitely stronger and more intense. 
        I did this because when I was a little kid, one of my all-time-favorite dreams was to fly like a bird. 
        <b>Finally, my dream was reached!</b>
