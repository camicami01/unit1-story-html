        A person who was near to me counted: 3…. 2…. 1…. GO! 
        I threw myself down the “launchpad” and I felt butterflies in my stomach. 
        I experienced the same feeling when I was in car and there was a big downhill; only that the feeling was stronger and more intense. 
        I did this because I always wanted to fly when I was a little kid.
