    <h2> Bungee jumping! 
        I know it sounds very strange and unusual knowing me, but after seeing numerous videos about people throwing themselves hanging to a rope, I really wanted to experience a similar thing once in a lifetime. 
        I went to Norway, where there are amazing waterfalls and landscapes! 
        I know you may seem shocked for what I did, I still am too! Do you remember when we were kids how scared we were to enter a class were there were older kids?
        Returning to the speech before, it was a very breathtaking adventure!
        Let me tell you more detailsâ€¦ </h2>
