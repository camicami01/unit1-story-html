    Bungee jumping! 
    I know it sounds very strange and unusual but after seeing numerous videos about people throwing themselves hanging to a rope, I really wanted to experience a similar thing. 
    I went in Norway, where there were amazing waterfalls! 
    I remember when we were kids how scared we were even only to enter in a class where there kids bigger than us! 
    Returning to the speech before, it was a very breathtaking reality! 
    Let me tell you more detailsâ€¦
