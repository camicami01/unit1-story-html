    <b><h1>A letter to a close friend</h1></b>
    <p>Dear friend,
        how are you? I remember our laughs together in MYP 1A! I miss you so much! I wish that I could see you again... if only you could come in Italy! 
        In this letter, I will share with you some of my adventures that I passed since you have been in England. 
        Before I start, I wanted to recount you that I remember when I told you "Lo sai che ieri Ã¨ morto il nonno di una mia amica" and you asked yourself why I tell you in that precise moment without reason! 
        And we laughed and laughed... ðŸ¤£ It was a very strange and unusual situation.
        I remember how we were positively excited about going on the trip to Turin! 
        Anyway, below you can decide which adventure you want to read between these two:
    </p>
