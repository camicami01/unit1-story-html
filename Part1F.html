   <p>  
        ... there was a fire in the middle of the night! Obviously I wanted to take part as a hero and I defended the helpless fauna from the flames: I went into the forest and saved all the koalas. 
        Unfortunately, since there was a lot of smoke and unbreathable air, I fainted; nothing very serious, I only went to the hospital and after a few days of rest I felt a lot better.
