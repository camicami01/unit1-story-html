   <p>  
        There was a fire in the middle of the night! Obviously I wanted to take part as a hero: I went into the forest and saved all the koalas. 
        Unfortunately, there was a lot of smoke and unbreathable air so I fainted, not so dangerous, I only went into the hospital and after a few days of rest I felt better.
