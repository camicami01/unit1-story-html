    <p>
        I saw someone throwing a cigarette near the grass of the forest that can easily burn. 
        Therefore, I immediately stopped him and I reported the fact to the police. 
        After that, thanks to my action, the man went to prison: I was so proud of myself, even if I think I saved just a little amount of koalas. 
        These would not prevent other people can do this again and create a disaster for nature.
