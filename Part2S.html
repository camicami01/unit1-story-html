    <p>
        I took a very deep breath, and in my head I counted backwards 3…. 2….. 1….. GO! 
        I was excited but at the same time, I felt fear and anxiety run into my veins. 
        Why am I doing this? In a millisecond, I reflected: I AM going to do this! I threw myself! Weeeeee! It was so cool! 
        It reminded me of when I did the somersault backwards in a adventure park where there were the ropes that held me and an elastic trampoline. 
        I was so scared, my mom took me there to have fun and spurred me on. 
        Finally I did it and I felt comfortable… but this is another story, so, lets continue with the heart-stopping and thrilling adventure from before.
