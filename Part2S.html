    <p>
        I took a very deep breath, and in my head I counted backwards 3… 2… 1… GO! 
        I was so excited that I was able to throw myself immediately and do such a thrilling experience.
        "I AM going to do this"! I told myself without any doubts.
        I immediately threw myself! Weeeeee! It was so cool! 
        It reminded me of when I did the somersault backwards in an adventure park where there were some ropes that held me on an elastic trampoline. 
        In this case, at first, I was so scared, even though my mom took me there to have fun and spur me on. 
        
        Today, I did something very extreme and I felt comfortable.
